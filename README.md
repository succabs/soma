# soma
 A Social Media App made with React, started with Vite.
 
 The name comes from a Finnish word "soma", which means pretty and cute. Just kidding, it is an acronym of Social Media App.
 
 The point of this project is to learn more about React, fill my portfolio and create a working front-end of a basic social media app. Created using various tutorials and reading docs.
