# Soma
A Social Media App made with React.
The layout of the app is old-schoolish, and it tries to bring back the feelings of old social media sites before they were cluttered with unneeded things. Both the design and functions are simple. No css frameworks are used. Everything is front-end only, data is stored on localStorage.

## Functionality

There are 1000 pre-generated users and you can log in using any number between 1 and 1000. At start there is no content because your localStorage is empty.

On the app users can:
- Log in/out
- Post and delete your own posts
- Comment on posts
- Like/dislike posts and comments
- Look at your own or other people's profiles
- Comment on profiles
- Search posts by content or hashtags

## TODO

- Use database instead of localStorage (= create back-end)
- Real authentication instead of logging in with numbers

## Install & run 

1. clone repository
2. npm install
3. npm run dev
4. have fun
