# Soma
 A Social Media App made with React, started with Vite.
 
The point of this project is to learn more about React, fill my portfolio and create a working front-end of a basic social media app. Created using various tutorials and reading docs.

The layout of the app is old-schoolish, and it tries to bring back the feelings of old social media sites before they were cluttered with unneeded things. Both the design and functions are simple. No css frameworks are used. Everything is front-end only, data is stored on localStorage. You can login using any number between 1 and 1000.

DISCLAIMER: This is a project currently under work, so some of the functions may not work since I am in the middle of implementing them.
